.emacs.d
========

I am tired of recreating my dev environment all the time, so I finally got around to putting it under a VCS. Any
tips, tricks, suggestions or criticisms welcome. This repository will contain my .emacs file and my .emacs.d
directory containing all 3rd party packages and extensions.
