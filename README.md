# .emacs.d

I am tired of recreating my dev environment all the time, so I finally got around to putting it under a VCS. Any
tips, tricks, suggestions or criticisms welcome. This repository contains my .emacs file and my .emacs.d
directory containing all 3rd party packages and extensions.


## *Caveat Emptor*
I am just learning Lisp/Emacs Lisp, so in no way should this code be viewed as optimal, or even correct!
